### Answer Key For PS4

#### General Notes
* Overhead is always much smaller than data
* Data blocks can be either the size of the file, or student might count the internal fragmentation of the next block too
* There are two legitimate ways to answer this question
  * If the whole file does not fit in one kind of indirection (i.e. direct, single, double or triple) then don't use it, but instead go to the next kind of indirection. This way is much easier to calculate
  * Or, fill each level of indirection before going to the next. This way is much more difficult to calculate but more realistic
* So there are two legitimate answers for each

### Part 1:

* Q1
  * Part 1: Small File, overhead memory: 60 bytes in either scenario
  * Part 2: Small file, data memory: 512B in either scenario
  * Part 3: Big file, overhead memory: about 9M in either scenario
  * Part 4: Big file, data memory, about 9G in either scenario

* Q2
  *
